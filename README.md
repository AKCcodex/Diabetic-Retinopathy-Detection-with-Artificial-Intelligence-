From the exploratory data analysis, I have concluded that the risk of diabetes depends upon the following factors:
1. Glucose level
2. Number of pregnancies
3. Skin Thickness
4. Insulin level
5. BMI

With in increase in Glucose level, insulin level, BMI and number of pregnancies, the risk of diabetes increases. However, the number of pregnancies have strange effect of risk of diabetes which couldn't be explained by the data. The risk of diabetes also increases with increase in skin thickness.

Coming to the classification models, Logistic Regression outperformed Random Forest and SVM with 78% accuracy. The accuracy of the model can be improved by increasing the size of the dataset. The dataset used for this project was very small and had only 768 rows.
